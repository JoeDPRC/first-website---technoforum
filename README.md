# first-website---technoforum
first web page I've built in CSS and HTML 


website is for a technology forum and is just the homepage. made up of one html sheet and one css sheet plus jpeg images.
All images were sorced from google images and I do not take ownership for them. Logo was built using microsoft word and paint. There are links to other various websites included in the anchors on the adverts button.
